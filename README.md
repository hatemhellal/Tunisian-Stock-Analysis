# Tunisian-Stock-Analysis


---


## Overview
This project aims to analyze historical stock price data and perform backtesting on various trading strategies. We'll convert `.txt` files containing stock data into `.csv` format and then explore the data using Python.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Collect your stock price data in `.txt` files. Ensure that each file contains relevant columns (e.g., date, open price, close price, volume).
   - Use the `pandas` library to read the files and concatenate them into a single DataFrame.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculate summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for each stock.
   - Identify outliers or anomalies.
   - Visualize stock price trends using line charts or candlestick plots.

3. **Backtesting Strategies**:
   - Define trading rules (e.g., moving average crossover, Bollinger Bands, etc.).
   - Simulate trades based on historical data.
   - Evaluate the performance of your strategy using metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and annualized return.
